// Hash Maps are usually the answer to improve Time Complexity
// If it's a sorted array, use Binary tree to achieve O(log N). Divide and Conquer - Divide the data set into smaller bits
// Try Sorting your input
// Hash tables and precomputed information (i.e sorted) are some of the best ways to optimize your code
// Look at the Time vs Space tradeoff. Sometimes storing extra space in memory can help the time. (Runtime)
// If the interviewer is giving you advice/tips/hints. Follow them
// Space time tradeoffs: Hashtables usually solve this a lot of the times. You can use more space, but you can get a time optimization to the process
